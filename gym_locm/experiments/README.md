# Experiments

This package contains the source-code for all experiments performed for our thesis <a href="#vieira2020a">[1]</a> 
and paper <a href="#vieira2020b">[2]</a>. They consist of: (i) a hyperparameter search script, (ii) a training 
script, (iii) a tournament runner script and a (iv) similarities script. Th steps to reproduce each experiment are
described as follows.
